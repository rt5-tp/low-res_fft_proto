**Prototyping a Visualisation**

This repository contains some files used in for early prototyping of the low-res-FFT visualisation. Python notebooks were used alongside Matplotlib and OpenCV to generate non-real-time versions of what could be expected on the LED matrix quickly. This allowed for the visualisation algorithms to be developed while real-time data acquisition was being developed. Then the algorithm was laid out in python scripts to support the development of a real-time implementation.
